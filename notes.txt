What the Volume column represents:

Trading Volume: The volume column represents the total number of Bitcoin units traded during a specific time period.
For example, if the volume for a particular day is 100,000, it means that a total of 100,000 Bitcoin units were traded on that day.
Market Activity: The volume can provide insights into the level of market activity or liquidity for Bitcoin.
Higher volumes generally indicate higher market participation and liquidity, while lower volumes may suggest lower activity or liquidity.
Price Movements: Changes in trading volume can often precede or accompany significant price movements in Bitcoin.
For example, a sudden increase in volume may indicate strong buying or selling pressure, potentially leading to price volatility.
Confirmation Indicator: Volume can act as a confirmation indicator for price trends.
For example, if Bitcoin prices are rising accompanied by increasing volume, it may indicate a stronger bullish trend.
Conversely, if prices are falling with high volume, it may indicate a stronger bearish trend.

Moving Averages:

Moving averages are statistical calculations used to analyze data points by creating a series of averages of different subsets of the full dataset.
They are commonly used in technical analysis to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles in the data.
There are different types of moving averages, but the two most common ones are:
Simple Moving Average (SMA): It calculates the average of a given set of prices over a specified period, equally weighting each price.
Exponential Moving Average (EMA): It gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to recent price changes compared to the SMA.
Moving averages help traders and analysts identify trends, reversals, and potential entry or exit points in financial markets.

Lag Features:

Lag features are created by shifting a feature or variable in time, effectively creating a lagged version of that feature.
In the context of time series data like stock prices, lag features represent historical values of a variable at different time points in the past.
By incorporating lag features into predictive models, you allow the model to learn from past observations and capture temporal dependencies in the data.
Lag features can help capture patterns such as seasonality, trends, and autocorrelation, which are important for time series forecasting tasks.
Commonly used lag features include lagged values of the target variable (e.g., lagged closing prices in predicting future prices) or lagged values of other relevant features.

In the code, the moving averages (both SMA and EMA) are computed based on the closing prices of Bitcoin.
These moving averages help smooth out short-term fluctuations in the price data and provide insights into longer-term trends.

Additionally, lag features are created by shifting the closing price of Bitcoin by different time periods (1, 3, and 7 days).
These lagged values allow the model to learn from past price movements and capture temporal dependencies that may be useful for predicting future prices.



Converting the date to Unix timestamp, because Hopsworks can not handle date type as it is:

Hopsworks Feature Store might not support the date data type as the event time column when online_enabled is set to True due to limitations in the online serving infrastructure.

In a real-time serving environment, data is typically stored in a format that allows for efficient indexing and querying to serve requests with low latency.
While datetime data types are commonly used for event time columns in batch processing or offline analysis,
they might not be supported for real-time serving due to indexing and performance considerations.

To address this issue, you can convert the date column to a data type that is supported for online serving,
such as a numeric timestamp (e.g., Unix timestamp) or a string representation of the date in a format that can be efficiently indexed (e.g., ISO 8601 format).
Once the column is converted to a supported data type, you should be able to set online_enabled to True without encountering errors.
